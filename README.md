# Minor_Project
In today's environment, we frequently encounter the issue of a shortage of time. Every 
day, each individual is required to perform a variety of tasks. As a result, people 
forgot to overlooking crucial information. To free up everyday time, we decided to 
construct a programme that would send message automatically to user communicate 
with them via instructions using web version of whatsapp i.e. Whatsapp Web since there 
isn't an official api for making bots.We are using python , selenium and its libraries to 
create this project.There are several bots which are used to solve the several task.They 
are used less frequently . They are useful in the business to communicate the which there 
clients or customer . These bots are designed in such a way to reply the feqruently asked 
question. Since there is no official api for the whatsapp So we can work with the 
Whatsapp easily by using the Selenium and Twilio . Twilio is the paid subscription 
platform. To reduce the cost we are using the selenium which is free to use. It helps to 
automate the whatsapp web page by finding elements of the page and interacting them 
according to the need.

For creating this application we are using the language python, flask framework, for storing the data 
we are using the database that is PostgreSQL. To make the user interface using HyperText Markup 
Language (HTML), Cascading Style Sheets (CSS ), and Bootstrap. The data is collected from the CSV 
file. These files are then processed by using the python libraries pandas and CSV reader. Pandas is an 
open-source Python package that is most widely used for data science/data analysis and machine 
learning tasks. It is used to clear the data, process files, and many other functions. For the automation 
process, we are using the Selenium and Web driver. Selenium is a powerful tool used to control the 
web browser through code and programming. There are many classes like action chain, selection 
support, exception class to handle the exception in the selenium there are many more classes and we 
are going to use these in our project. WebDriver is a compact object-oriented API and it drives the 
browser effectively. Web driver helps us to download the WhatsApp website and helps us to interact 
with these various attributes.
